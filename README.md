# Daily-Planner

This is a daily scheduler. Every hour has it's own time slot from 9am to 5pm. You can write what to do in every hour slot and the information is stored in your local. 

Current Time Display: There's this clock up top showing the current time (we're talking EST). Updates every second 

Time Slots for Each Hour: Each work hour has its own box. Just click and type in your to-dos.

Save Your Stuff: Hit the save icon next to each hour and then your notes are saved. Come back any time, and they'll still be there.

Colors Change with Time: Past hours go one color, the present hour is another, future hours another.

Pop-Up Alert: Every time you save something, you get a little 'Hey, I saved it!' alert. Just so you know it worked.
